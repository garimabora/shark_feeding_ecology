## Abstract
The diets of _Carcharhinus limbatus_, _Scoliodon laticaudus_, _Chiloscyllium arabicum_ and _Ch. Griesum_ from the west coast of India were investigated. We compared trophic resource use and overlap across and within benthic and pelagic habitat guilds, between the two sympatric species belonging to family Hemiscyliidae, and between the life stages of _S. laticaudus_. It was observed that there was a significant difference in the diet composition of benthic and pelagic shark species. There was no difference in the diet of the two sympatric _Chiloscyllium_ species. _S. laticaudus_ showed an ontogenetic dietary niche shift from an invertebrate-rich to an ichthyophagous diet. Specifically, _C. limbatus_ showed an ichthyophagous diet while _S. laticaudus_ showed a diet consisting of both benthic and pelagic prey. _C. arabicum, C. griesum, and S. laticaudus_ were less dependent on teleosts and displayed similar diet composition.  The study also found that several of the prey species were commercially important fish species caught in the fisheries of Malvan. Thus a change in the relative abundance of either prey or predators due to fishing pressure could influence coastal food webs, leading to impacts both on ecosystems and fisheries.
